# Web-FindHireMe

**FindHireMe** is a website to find information about open jobs and apply to it. There are three types of userâ€™s role in this website: Recruiter, Job Seeker, and Guest (non-logged-in user). The recruiter can manage the open job on the website, the job seeker can look at the information and apply for the job, while the guest can only look at the information of the jobs.

## Creative Thinking

  * Use SOFT DELETE to keep data integrity on the status page.
  * Create a lot of view components to prevent duplicate codes.
  * Use factory faker as database seeder (with a lot of settings).
  * Hide unused timestamps from database tables.


## Deployment

  * Create MySQL database named `findhireme` on `127.0.0.1:3306` with `root` username and no password. You can customize the ip address, port, database username or password based on your own machine setup.
  * Run `composer install` to download all dependencies needed.
  * Run `cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate` to prepare all important data.
  * Run `php artisan storage:link` to create symbolic link to public storage directory.
  * Run `composer dump-autoload` to autoload seeder files.
  * Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create and fill the database.
  * Run `php artisan serve` and access the webapp on localhost port 8000.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
